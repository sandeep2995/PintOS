PintOS
======

These are lab assignments done for Operating Systems Lab.

The original work was not done using any kind of version control and hence there are seperate copies of the code for seperate assignments.

Please read the design docs to understand the working of the code implemented.

Assignment 1 is built over original PintOS, assignment 2 over 1. 3 and 4 both are built over assignment 2.

Assignment 1: Scheduling

Assignment 2: User Programs

Assignment 3: Virtual Memory

Assignment 4: File System (bug: Persistence not working)
